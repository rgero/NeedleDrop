# Needle Drop
For my partner's birthday in 2025, I purchased them a record player. After that, we quickly dove into the world of records, quickly amassing nearly a dozen from some of our favorite artists. This started to present a problem. How do we remember which records we already bought?
**That's the goal of this website.**
There are already tools out there that let you do this, but some charge a monthly subscription that I'd like to avoid if possible. Plus this kind of stuff is fun to play with.

## What features do I want?
I want the ability to easily add, manipulate, view and share a list of records that I own, as well as the ones that are in my household

## What data do I want to get?
Right now I am thinking that the following data would be worth tracking
- Artist Name
- Album Name
- Price
- Location Purchased
- Date Purchased
- Who purchased
- Any notes

I feel that the only required fields will be artist name, album name, and who purchased it. The rest could be used to drive metrics. I enjoy the idea of making a catalog of business that we've purchased records from, so we can see how many we've purchased from where.
